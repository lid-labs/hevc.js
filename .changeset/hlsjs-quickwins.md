Muxed A/V refusal and compute-aware ABR for hls.js:

- Core (**behavior change**): the MSE intercept now refuses muxed audio+video HEVC mimes (an HEVC codec alongside an audio codec in the same `codecs` list, e.g. `"hvc1...,mp4a.40.2"`) instead of intercepting the video-only path and silently dropping the audio track. `isTypeSupported`/`decodingInfo` answer unsupported so players that probe the combined mime (dash.js) filter these renditions upfront; `addSourceBuffer` passes the mime through with a loud error for players that probe codecs separately (hls.js). Previously such a mime reported supported and played without audio. New `isMuxedHevcMime` export; `HEVC_CODEC_RE` no longer swallows the audio codec after a comma. `@hevcjs/dashjs-plugin` inherits this refusal through its core dependency bump.
- Shaka plugin: the transmuxer reports muxed A/V HEVC mimes as unsupported for the same reason.
- hls.js plugin: `attachHevcSupport` now returns a callable handle with `attachComputeAware(hls)` — compute-aware ABR capping `hls.autoLevelCapping` when the device can't transcode in real time (on by default, `adaptiveCompute: false` to opt out). Warns when `ManagedMediaSource` is present and could bypass the intercept.
